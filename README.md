📊 Project Tracker (Excel)

File: project_tracker.xlsx

I built this to manage project tasks in a simple way. It includes:

Tasks with start/end dates, owners, and % complete

Conditional formatting that highlights overdue work

A basic Gantt chart made from a stacked bar chart

It’s not a fancy PM software, but it shows how Excel can be used to keep a project on track.

⚠️ Risk Register (Excel)

File: risk_register.xlsx

This is a risk log that I’d use on real projects. It tracks:

Risk description, probability, impact, and owner

A calculated risk score (probability × impact)

Color coding for high/medium/low risks

It’s a simple but effective way to keep an eye on risks before they become problems.

📝 Meeting Notes Template (Word)

File: meeting_notes_template.docx

A reusable template for project meetings. It has space for:

Agenda and discussion notes

An action items table with task, owner, deadline, and status

I made this to save time during recurring team meetings — no more starting from scratch each time.

📑 Project Proposal (PowerPoint)

File: project_proposal.pptx

A short slide deck you could use to pitch a project. It covers:

Objectives and deliverables

A simple month-by-month timeline

Key risks to watch for

It’s clean and to the point — meant for quick presentations to a manager or stakeholder.

🚀 Why I Made This

I wanted to show that I can apply project management practices using everyday MS Office tools.
These files are also useful for me to practice skills like:

Structuring data in Excel

Using formulas and conditional formatting

Creating reusable templates

Presenting ideas clearly in PowerPoint
